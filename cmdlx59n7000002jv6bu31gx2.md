### **Welcome to Day 6 of my 27-day DSA journey using Striver’s SDE Sheet!**

### 1️⃣**Find the repeating and missing numbers**

🔸 Problem Statement:

Given an integer array **nums** of size **n** containing values from **\[1, n\]** and **each** value appears **exactly** once in the array, except for **A**, which appears **twice** and **B** which is **missing**.

Return the values **A** and **B**, as an array of size 2, where **A** appears in the **0-th** index and **B** in the **1st** index.

**Note:** You are not allowed to modify the original array.

```plaintext
Examples:
Input: nums = [3, 5, 4, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 2]

Explanation: 1 appears two times in the array and 2 is missing from nums

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 5, 7]

Output: [7, 4]

Explanation: 7 appears two times in the array and 4 is missing from nums.
```

**Constraints:**

* n == nums.length
    
* 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>
    
* n - 2 elements in nums appear exactly once and are valued between \[1, n\].
    
* 1 element in nums appears twice, and is valued between \[1, n\].
    

### 💠Real-Life Example:

Imagine you're a teacher checking exam roll numbers.  
You expect each student to have a **unique roll number from 1 to n**.  
But by mistake:

* One student **used another’s roll number**
    
* One student **missed writing theirs**
    

Now your task is to find:

* **Who repeated?**
    
* **Who is missing?**
    

📌 And no—you **can’t mark on the attendance sheet** (you can't modify the array)!

### 📍Brute Force Approach

### ➡️ Idea:

Check each number from 1 to n:

* Count how many times it appears in the array
    
* If frequency is 2 → that’s duplicate
    

If frequency is 0 → that’s missing

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findMissingRepeatingNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] freq = new int[n + 1];

        // Count frequencies
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }

        int repeating = -1, missing = -1;
        // Find which number appears twice and which is missing
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (freq[i] == 2) {
                repeating = i;
            } else if (freq[i] == 0) {
                missing = i;
            }
        }

        return new int[]{repeating, missing};
    }
}
```

### 📍Time Complexity: O(n)

### 📍Space Complexity: O(n)

(Extra array used)

👎 **Not allowed in interviews** where extra space is restricted.  

### 💠Optimal Approach – Using Math (Without Modifying Array)

### \=&gt; Smart Trick using **Sum and Sum of Squares**

### Concept:

Let:

* `S` = Sum of first n natural numbers = `n(n+1)/2`
    
* `S2` = Sum of squares of first n natural numbers = `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`
    

Let `x` be the missing number and `y` be the repeating number.

From given array:

* Let `actualSum = sum of nums`
    
* Let `actualSqSum = sum of squares of nums`
    

Then:

```plaintext
Equation 1: actualSum = S - x + y  ⇒  (y - x) = actualSum - S  
Equation 2: actualSqSum = S2 - x² + y²  ⇒ (y² - x²) = actualSqSum - S2  
```

Now:

* y - x = diff1
    
* y² - x² = (y - x)(y + x) = diff2  
    ⇒ Solve these two equations to find `x` and `y`
    

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findMissingRepeatingNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long S = (long) n * (n + 1) / 2;
        long S2 = (long) n * (n + 1) * (2L * n + 1) / 6;

        long actualSum = 0;
        long actualSqSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            actualSum += num;
            actualSqSum += (long) num * num;
        }

        long diff1 = actualSum - S;       // y − x
        long diff2 = actualSqSum - S2;    // y² − x²

        long sumYX = diff2 / diff1;       // (y + x)

        long y = (diff1 + sumYX) / 2;     // repeating number
        long x = sumYX - y;               // missing number

        return new int[]{(int) y, (int) x};
    }
}
```

### 📍Time Complexity:

* O(n) ✅
    

### 📍 Space Complexity:

* O(1) ✅  
    (No extra space, just variables)
    

💠(Hinglish:

* **Math lagao, array mat chhedo** – use sum and sum of squares
    
* **Do equations banao** – y - x and y² - x²
    
* **Divide & conquer** se solve karo
    
* **Space bilkul nahi lena hai** – use variables only
    
* **Fast and clean solution** – interviewer ko pasand aayega ✅)
    

## 💠Bonus – Why at least one duplicate and missing exists?

Because:

* You have numbers in `[1, n]`
    
* But one number repeats → **Someone must be missing**
    
* It's like saying: "Ek seat pe do baithe, toh ek seat khali reh gayi!"
    

## 💠Final Thoughts:

This problem is a perfect example of using **math to optimize space**.  
Instead of searching element-by-element, we used **sum tricks** to calculate the answer with clean logic.

### 2️⃣**Count inversions in an array**

🔸 Problem Statement:

Given an array of N integers, count the inversion of the array (using [merge-sort](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/merge-sort-algorithm/))[.](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/merge-sort-algorithm/)

What is an inversion of an array? Definition: for all i & j &lt; size of array, if i [&lt; j then](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/merge-sort-algorithm/) you have to find pair (A\[i\],A\[j\]) such that A\[j\] &lt; A\[i\].

```plaintext
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Result: 0
Explanation: we have a sorted array and the sorted array has 0 inversions as for i < j you will never find a pair such that A[j] < A[i]. More clear example: 2 has index 1 and 5 has index 4 now 1 < 5 but 2 < 5 so this is not an inversion.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
Result: 10
Explanation: we have a reverse sorted array and we will get the maximum inversions as for i < j we will always find a pair such that A[j] < A[i]. Example: 5 has index 0 and 3 has index 2 now (5,3) pair is inversion as 0 < 2 and 5 > 3 which will satisfy out conditions and for reverse sorted array we will get maximum inversions and that is (n)*(n-1) / 2.For above given array there is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 inversions.

Example 3:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {5,3,2,1,4}
Result: 7
Explanation: There are 7 pairs (5,1), (5,3), (5,2), (5,4),(3,2), (3,1), (2,1) and we have left 2 pairs (2,4) and (1,4) as both are not satisfy our condition. 
```

### 📍 Real-Life Example:

Imagine a queue of students standing in height order for a class photo. Normally, **shorter students** should stand in front (sorted order).  
If a **taller student** stands in front of a **shorter one**, that's **"inversion"** in our lineup!

> In DSA, that’s exactly what we call an *inversion* in an array.

## 📍Trick to Remember:

> "Whenever a **bigger number comes before** a **smaller one**, inversion mil gaya bhai!"

## 💠 Brute Force Approach:

### Logic:

* Run 2 nested loops (`i` and `j`)
    
* Check every pair `(i, j)` where `i < j`
    
* Count if `arr[i] > arr[j]`
    

```java
class Solution {
    public long numberOfInversions(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### 📍Time Complexity: O(N²)

### 📍 Space Complexity: O(1)

> ❌ Not suitable for large arrays!

## 💠Optimal Approach – Using Modified Merge Sort

## 📍 Idea

While merging two sorted halves, if any element from **right half** is **smaller** than from **left**, then all elements from `left[i]` to `mid` are greater than `right[j]` – so count them as inversions.

## 📍Dry Run Kar Ke Samjho:

Let’s say we are merging two sorted subarrays:  
`Left: [2, 5]` and `Right: [1, 3]`  
While comparing 2 & 1 → 2 &gt; 1 → means 2 and 5 are greater than 1 → count += 2

```java
public class Solution {
    public long numberOfInversions(int[] nums) {
        return mergeSortCount(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }

    private long mergeSortCount(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        long cnt = 0;
        if (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            cnt += mergeSortCount(arr, low, mid);
            cnt += mergeSortCount(arr, mid + 1, high);
            cnt += merge(arr, low, mid, high);
        }
        return cnt;
    }

    private long merge(int[] arr, int low, int mid, int high) {
        List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
        int left = low, right = mid + 1;
        long cnt = 0;
        while (left <= mid && right <= high) {
            if (arr[left] <= arr[right]) {
                temp.add(arr[left++]);
            } else {
                temp.add(arr[right++]);
                cnt += (mid - left + 1);
            }
        }
        while (left <= mid) temp.add(arr[left++]);
        while (right <= high) temp.add(arr[right++]);
        for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) arr[i] = temp.get(i - low);
        return cnt;
    }
}
```

### 📍Time Complexity: O(N log N)

### 📍 Space Complexity: O(1)

> ✅ Efficient even for large arrays. Merge Sort is

### 💠(Hinglish :

* **Inversion ka matlab hai** – jab koi bada number pehle ho aur chhota baad mein ho (`i < j` but `arr[i] > arr[j]`)
    
* Brute force chalega small inputs ke liye, but large inputs me timeout milega
    
* Merge sort ko modify karke hum inversions count kar sakte hai during merge phase – bina extra loop ke
    
* Time Complexity `O(N log N)` = sorted array jaisa fast, easy to apply in interviews)
    

## 📌 Final Takeaway:

If you're given a problem to count inversion in an array:

* Brute force = simple, but slow
    
* Merge sort = fast and optimal

## ✍️ Final Notes:

If you're just starting your DSA journey like me, don't worry if you don’t get it perfect the first time.  
**Visualize → Dry Run → Optimize.**  
Stay consistent, and let’s crack every problem from brute to optimal! 💪
